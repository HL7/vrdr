Justification: For public health reporting purposes, anonymous identifiers are occasionally
               used for protecting patient identity in reporting certain results. For instance, a state
               health department may choose to use a scheme for generating an anonymous identifier for
               reporting a patient that has had a positive human immunodeficiency virus antibody test.
               Anonymous identifiers can be used in PID 3 by replacing the medical record number or other
               non-anonymous identifier. The assigning authority for an anonymous identifier would be
               the state/local health department.</td>

A DEA number has a very precise and widely accepted meaning within the United States.
               Surprisingly, the US Drug Enforcement Administration does not solely assign DEA numbers
               in the United States. Hospitals have the authority to issue DEA numbers to their medical
               residents. These DEA numbers are based upon the hospitalâ€™s DEA number, but the authority
               rests with the hospital on the assignment to the residents. Thus, DEA as an Identifier
               Type is necessary in addition to DEA as an Assigning Authority.</td>

               requires distinct identifier types to accurately interpret component 1. Additionally,
               the distinction among these license types is critical in most health care settings (this
               is not to convey full licensing information, which requires a segment to support all related

Justification: For public health reporting purposes, anonymous identifiers are occasionally
         used for protecting patient identity in reporting certain results. For instance, a state

         reporting a patient that has had a positive human immunodeficiency virus antibody test.
         Anonymous identifiers can be used in PID 3 by replacing the medical record number or other
         non-anonymous identifier. The assigning authority for an anonymous identifier would be

Use case: This is a registration number that identifies an individual or organization

A DEA number has a very precise and widely accepted meaning within the United States.
         Surprisingly, the US Drug Enforcement Administration does not solely assign DEA numbers
         in the United States. Hospitals have the authority to issue DEA numbers to their medical
         residents. These DEA numbers are based upon the hospitalâ€™s DEA number, but the authority
         rests with the hospital on the assignment to the residents. Thus, DEA as an Identifier
         Type is necessary in addition to DEA as an Assigning Authority.">

         assistant licenses all issued by one state medical board. For this case, the CX data type

         the distinction among these license types is critical in most health care settings (this
