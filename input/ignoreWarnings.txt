# The US Core does not have an Observation profile that is applicable to the needs of vital records death reporting

US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Observation derive from one of the base US profiles

# Use of the US Core document reference and condition resource profiles by VRDR has been reviewed by the USRSC and changes to the US Core profiles are being considered,  a JIRA ticket has been created (FHIR-27904).

US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on DocumentReference derive from the core US profile

# Code value for condition.code is a codeable concept represented as text only when outbound from State EDRS to NCHS. 

No code provided, and a code should be provided from the value set http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ValueSet/us-core-condition-code (http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ValueSet/us-core-condition-code)

The Implementation Guide contains no examples for this profile
