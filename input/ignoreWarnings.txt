# May be best practice, but not needed in this IG.  For vital records reporting the performer and effective time are  either/or/both not known, or not important.  These are not really clinical observations, but abstracted facts represented using Observation resources.
Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have a performer
Best Practice Recommendation: In general, all observations should have an effective[x] ()
