### Scope
The scope of this VRDR FHIR IG is the reporting of incidents of death by State Registrars to the NCHS. The data content of this dataflow contains an aggregation of data collected in preceding dataflows and used in additional dataflows related to the secondary use of death information such as clinical research, law enforcement, and health policy determination.

While the scope of this IG is limited to death reporting by State Registrars to the NCHS, the FHIR Resource Profiles have been designed with the intent of being reusable in related preceding and antecedent dataflows.
