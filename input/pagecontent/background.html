CDCs National Center for Health Statistics is working closely with Federal, State, and local partners to take a fresh look at how mortality data are gathered, stored, and exchanged across the United States. They are focused on adopting best practices for information exchange that lessen the burden on data providers (e.g., vital records offices, medical examiner and coroner offices, toxicology labs) while providing a seamlessly automated data feed to public health and public safety data requestors. 

To help make the mortality data ecosystem more connected, adaptable, and robust, they have chosen to leverage modern technologies and approaches, such as RESTful based APIs and HL7s Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard.

This implementation guide is an initial step to help define a common set of protocols and practices that developers can rely on to enhance their existing products and build solutions to help make mortality data flow more seamlessly.
