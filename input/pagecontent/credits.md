* The development of the VRDR implementation guide by the [development team](credits.html#development-team) was performed under contract to CDC/NCHS/DVS under the direction of the [project facilitators](credits.html#project-facilitators).
* The published content of this guide was developed using [FHIR Shorthand syntax](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/shorthand/) and the [SUSHI tookit](https://fshschool.org/docs/sushi/), a free, open source toolchain from the [MITRE]. Generous guidance on FHIR Shorthand and SUSHI was provided by Chris Moesel.
